A board I made to play with an old HDSP-211X display commonly found in Motorola MicroTAC series of phones. The charger IC is an MP2724, featuring I2C, USB-C cc protocol, legacy DPDM port detection, OVP, timers, watchdogs, you name it. And its capable of charging at 2A with 3A FETs!

This is in the series towards rebuilding my Motorola MicroTAC phones.
