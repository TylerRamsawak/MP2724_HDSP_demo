A board I made to play with an old HDSP-211X display commonly found in Motorola MicroTAC series of phones. The charger IC is an MP2724, featuring I2C, USB-C cc protocol, legacy DPDM port detection, OVP, timers, watchdogs, you name it. And its capable of charging at 2A with 3A FETs! I can't begin to describe how long I've looked for a charger just like this.

This is in the series towards rebuilding my Motorola MicroTAC phones.
